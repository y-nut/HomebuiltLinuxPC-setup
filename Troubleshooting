Biggest issues: Graphics

<h3>Graphics</h3>
The biggest issues I had for any Linux distro was the grapics compatibility. I often had a blue screen with this error in
a grey box before the desktop had actually started:

<div align="center">
          Failed to start xserver<br/>
        ...
</div> 

        
This error is apparantly caused because there is no graphics driver. I solved that by typing (from fresh install):
<ol>
<li>Ctrl+Alt+F1 (to shell)</li>
<li>sudo su</li>
<li>cd (directs to root.)</>
<li>sudo Xorg -configure</>
<li><code>li</code>  Ensure there is a file called "xorg.conf.new" here</li>
<li><code>cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>
<li><code>startx</code> starts the xserver and restart the machine, hopefully on the desktop</li>
</ol>

After installation of Ubuntu 12.04 I had the following error:

          The system is running in low graphics mode before opening the desktop. I coudn't open desktop
          in failsafe mode. Eventually I found out how to solve it:
          
          1. Ctrl+Alt+F1 and credentials
          sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg
          sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
          sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
          
          At this point the video card output didn't work (flashing output) so
          I connected a monitor to the motherboard and installed the AMD drivers:
          
I ran a glmark2 test after installation to test if my graphics card (AMD/ATI Bonaire R7 260x?) was installed correctly.
I scored 190, which is low. After the installation of the AMD drivers I got 4150. Therefore I had to install the drivers.

I used a .deb installer (1) to install it:
