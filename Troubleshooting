Biggest issues: Graphics

<h3>Graphics</h3>
The biggest issues I had for any Linux distro was the grapics compatibility. I often had a blue screen with this error in
a grey box before the desktop had actually started:

<div align="center">
          Failed to start xserver<br/>
        ...
</div> 

        
This error is apparantly caused because there is no graphics driver. I solved that by typing (from fresh install):
<ol>
<li>Ctrl+Alt+F1 (to shell)</li>
<li>sudo su</li>
<li>cd (directs to root.)</>
<li>sudo Xorg -configure</>
<li><code>li</code>  Ensure there is a file called "xorg.conf.new" here</li>
<li><code>cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>
<li><code>startx</code> starts the xserver and restart the machine, hopefully on the desktop</li>
</ol>
