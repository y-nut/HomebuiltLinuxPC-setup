After installation
I ran a glmark2 test after installation to test if my graphics card (AMD/ATI Bonaire R7 260x?) was installed correctly.
I scored 190, which is low. I was supposed to get a score of 4000 sth. Therefore I had to install the drivers.


Update system (Graphics drivers)

http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1316 (If, for some reason the installer above doesn't work)

Once the AMD Catalyst Control Center is installed I have experienced there are black bars around the screen.
In order to remove them:

7. sudo aticonfig --initial -f
8. sudo aticonfig --vs=on
9. sudo aticonfig --set-pcs-u32=MCIL,HWUVD_H264Level51Support,1
sudo service lightdm stop (now you are directed to shell)
sudo aticonfig --set-pcs-val=MCIL,DigitalHDTVDefaultUnderscan,0 
10. sudo reboot 

The reboot has to be immediate after the previous step.
In case the bars are back when you restart the computer, repeat the procedure. I had to do it 3 times before it was permanent.
You can also adjust the bars manually for overscan/underscan although it will be reset on reboot. 
Open amdcccle and set the resolution to the lowest for one monitor. In my case it was 600x800. Then go to the settings for the screen and adjust 
the overscan to 0 %. apply this and go back and set the resolution to the desired. Then the overlay settings will be 'transferred'
The overscan properties are not accessible on higher resolutions - don't know why..
